# Python Subset Interpreter

This is a tree-walk interpreter written in Rust for a subset of Python, developed as a part of my bachelor's thesis.

## Usage
[Install Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html)

Inside the project directory run:
```
cargo run [path]
```
to run with the specified file (e.g. examples/fib_list.py).

```
cargo run
```
to run the REPL.
